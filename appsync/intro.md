# What is AppSync?

```
AWS AppSync is a fully managed service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to data sources like AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and more.
```

It automates a lot for you based off of a GraphQL Schema. Most of your heavy app logic can be taken care of just from starting off with a solid schema before you really start building out the rest of your app.

For example, you can define DynamoDB tables, the schema for each entity, the relationships between them, and permissions of authenticated users all from a schema designed at the very start.
